This code feeds Stockfish FEN positions to be analyzed.
The analysis is taken from Stockfish and written to JSON files.

There are two C Sharp code files.
One is the library itself.
The other is a Unit test which tests the code and shows how to call the libarary.

The code is setup to analyze Chess 960 opening positions.
The code can be tweaked to analyze regular chess positions.
